p = input ("enter value p:")
n = input ("enter value n:")
r = input ("enter rate r:")
interest = (float(p)*float(n)*float(r))/36000
print (interest)
t = input ("enter tax value t")
tax = float (interest)* float (t)/100
print(tax)



c='Hi There'
print c(1)

the above cide is for interest calculation.

Argentina tax calculation is tough to handle.
